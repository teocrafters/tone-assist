# Quality Standards for Real-Time Audio Analysis

Core quality standards for the RTA project focusing on audio processing
correctness, real-time performance, and maintainable code patterns.

## Audio Engineering Standards

### Signal Processing Correctness

- VALIDATE all audio parameters within physically meaningful ranges
- PREVENT filter instability through proper coefficient bounds checking
- ENSURE proper gain staging to avoid clipping and maintain dynamic range
- IMPLEMENT mathematically correct frequency response calculations
- HANDLE edge cases: DC (0 Hz), Nyquist frequency, extreme Q values

### Real-Time Performance Requirements

- MAINTAIN audio processing within frame budget (2.67ms at 48kHz, 128 samples)
- ACHIEVE consistent 60fps canvas rendering during continuous audio updates
- MINIMIZE memory allocations in audio processing loops (target: zero per frame)
- OPTIMIZE for low-latency operation (< 10ms end-to-end latency)
- PREVENT audio dropouts through efficient buffer management

### Web Audio API Best Practices

- INITIALIZE `AudioContext` with appropriate latency hint (`'interactive'`)
- HANDLE `AudioContext` suspension (especially iOS Safari)
- CLEAN UP `AudioNodes` properly on component unmount
- VALIDATE browser support and provide graceful degradation
- USE proper async/await patterns for audio initialization

## Canvas Rendering Standards

### Performance Requirements

- TARGET 60fps (16.67ms frame budget) for smooth visualization
- BATCH drawing operations to minimize context state changes
- REUSE objects (`Path2D`, gradients, `ImageData`) across frames
- SUPPORT HiDPI displays with proper device pixel ratio scaling
- PROFILE render performance and identify bottlenecks

### Memory Management

- PRE-ALLOCATE all buffers during initialization, not in render loops
- AVOID object creation in `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks
- CACHE expensive calculations (gradients, paths, transformations)
- MONITOR memory usage and prevent accumulation over time
- IMPLEMENT object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Standards

- ENFORCE strict mode with explicit return types for functions
- USE specific Web Audio API types (`AudioContext`, `AnalyserNode`, etc.)
- DEFINE custom types for audio parameters and configurations
- AVOID `any` type - create proper interfaces for audio data structures
- VALIDATE input parameters at function boundaries

### Error Handling Patterns

- PROVIDE graceful degradation when Web Audio API unavailable
- HANDLE microphone access denials with user-friendly messages
- RECOVER from `AudioContext` suspension and resumption
- LOG audio processing errors with sufficient context for debugging
- PREVENT cascading failures in audio processing chain

### Function Design Principles

- LIMIT function length to 20 lines for readability and testability
- SEPARATE concerns: audio processing, visualization, state management
- USE pure functions for audio calculations when possible
- IMPLEMENT single responsibility principle for audio components
- DOCUMENT complex audio algorithms with architectural comments only

## Testing Standards

### Audio Processing Tests

- MOCK Web Audio API components for deterministic testing
- VALIDATE filter frequency responses with known test signals
- TEST edge cases: silence, clipping, extreme frequencies
- VERIFY parameter clamping and validation logic
- MEASURE processing performance and memory usage

### Canvas Rendering Tests

- VERIFY HiDPI scaling calculations
- TEST render performance under continuous data updates
- VALIDATE memory usage during extended operation
- CHECK visual correctness with known audio data patterns
- ENSURE frame rate stability during stress testing

### Integration Tests

- TEST complete audio processing chain from microphone to visualization
- VERIFY browser compatibility across Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- VALIDATE PWA functionality and offline operation
- CHECK mobile device performance and touch interactions
- ENSURE proper cleanup and resource management

## Browser Compatibility Standards

### Chrome/Chromium (Primary Target)

- LEVERAGE full Web Audio API feature set
- OPTIMIZE for V8 JavaScript engine performance characteristics
- USE latest Canvas optimization techniques
- TEST with DevTools performance profiling

### Safari (Including iOS)

- HANDLE `AudioContext` suspension on page load
- IMPLEMENT proper user gesture handling for audio initialization
- SUPPORT PWA installation and app-like behavior
- TEST on both macOS Safari and iOS Safari

### Firefox

- ACCOMMODATE alternative Web Audio API implementation details
- VALIDATE canvas rendering performance differences
- TEST filter stability with Firefox's audio processing
- ENSURE consistent behavior across Gecko engine

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Collection

- TRACK frame rates during continuous audio processing
- MEASURE audio processing latency and jitter
- MONITOR memory usage patterns and GC pressure
- LOG performance degradation events
- COLLECT user device capabilities and performance data

### Performance Budgets

- AUDIO LATENCY: < 10ms end-to-end (microphone to speakers)
- CANVAS RENDER: < 8ms per frame (50% of 16.67ms budget)
- MEMORY GROWTH: < 1MB per hour of operation
- CPU USAGE: < 30% on mid-range devices
- FRAME DROPS: < 1% of frames over 5-minute period

## Security Considerations

### Microphone Access

- REQUEST microphone permission with clear user consent
- HANDLE permission denials gracefully
- RESPECT user privacy - no audio data leaves the device
- IMPLEMENT proper permission state management
- PROVIDE visual indicators when microphone is active

### Content Security Policy

- CONFIGURE CSP headers to allow necessary audio processing
- RESTRICT unnecessary permissions and capabilities
- VALIDATE all user inputs to audio processing functions
- PREVENT XSS through proper data sanitization

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- USE `AGENT-NOTE` comments for performance-critical sections
- DOCUMENT complex audio algorithms and their mathematical basis
- EXPLAIN browser-specific workarounds and compatibility code
- PROVIDE examples for audio processing utilities and helpers
- MAINTAIN up-to-date API documentation for public interfaces

### User Documentation

- EXPLAIN audio requirements and browser compatibility
- PROVIDE troubleshooting guide for common audio issues
- DOCUMENT performance expectations and device requirements
- INCLUDE visual examples of expected behavior
- MAINTAIN changelog with audio feature updates
